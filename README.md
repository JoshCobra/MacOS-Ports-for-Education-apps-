# MacOS-Ports-for-Education-apps-

The aim of this repository is to port educational applications from Windows to MacOS, focusing on software that is either 
unavailable natively for MacOS or performs better in a Windows environment. 
These efforts are targeted at improving access to essential educational tools for MacOS users.

This project leverages my knowledge of both operating systems and contributions from the open-source community.
To achieve these ports, I am using Wineskin as the foundational tool to facilitate the process of running Windows applications on MacOS.
More details on Wineskin can be found in the official repository:
- WineskinServer by Gcenx. https://github.com/Gcenx/WineskinServer

Additionally, various add-ons and configurations may be required to ensure the proper functioning of the ported applications.

If a similar project already exists or if you have relevant expertise, I encourage you to reach out. 
I am open to collaboration or, if necessary, ensuring proper attribution of existing work.
